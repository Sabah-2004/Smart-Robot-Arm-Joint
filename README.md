# Smart Robot Arm Joint 🤖🔩

This project contains the 3D CAD design of a mechanical joint used in a robotic arm. The assembly was created using *Onshape* and demonstrates basic mechanical motion using mates.

## 📁 Project Structure
- Part Studio: Contains individual parts of the joint.
- Assembly: Demonstrates how the parts fit together using *cylindrical* and *planar* mates.

## ⚙ Features
- Fully articulated joint with cylindrical rotation.
- Parametric design using Onshape tools.
- Ideal for robotic arm prototypes and educational purposes.

## 📐 Tools Used
- Onshape (3D CAD)
- Mate constraints: Cylindrical, Planar
